# My Reads Project
This project is developed using React.js and React Router
The game is transpiled to ES5 for legacy browser compatibility.

## Getting Started

You will need to have yarn install, although node equivalent will work
just as well.

```
yarn install
yarn start
```
Then the application will be running on

```
http://localhost:3000/
```

### Installing

Any browser in a desktop device will be able to
play and render this project.

Mobile devices are not supported at this time.

## Built With

* [Webstorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/) - IDE that I like using.
* [Babel](https://babeljs.io/repl/#?babili=false&evaluate=true&lineWrap=false&presets=es2015) - ES6 to ES5 online transpiler.
